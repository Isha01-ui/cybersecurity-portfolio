# Web App Pentesting

This folder contains hands-on projects and labs related to web application penetration testing.  
Here, I practice techniques such as:

- SQL Injection
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- Authentication and Session Testing
- Security misconfiguration analysis

Each subfolder or file contains detailed steps, methodologies, and lessons learned from the exercises.
