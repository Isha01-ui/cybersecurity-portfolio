# ICS Protocols

## Overview
- ICS protocols are used for communication between PLCs, SCADA systems, RTUs, and HMIs.
- Understanding them is crucial for both operation and security analysis.

## Common Protocols

### 1. Modbus
- Simple protocol for PLC communication.
- Often **unencrypted**, making it vulnerable to sniffing and injection.
- Types: Modbus RTU (serial), Modbus TCP (Ethernet).

### 2. S7 (Siemens)
- Proprietary Siemens protocol used in PLCs.
- Vulnerabilities include weak authentication and protocol flaws.
- Used in many industrial environments.

### 3. DNP3 (Distributed Network Protocol)
- Used in electrical and water utilities.
- Supports secure authentication in newer versions.
- Older versions vulnerable to replay attacks.

### 4. OPC (OLE for Process Control)
- Standard for data exchange in industrial automation.
- Can use OPC Classic (COM-based) or OPC UA (modern, secure).

## Security Considerations
- Many ICS protocols are **not encrypted** by default.
- Strong authentication and network segmentation are critical.
- Monitoring traffic for anomalies can prevent attacks.
