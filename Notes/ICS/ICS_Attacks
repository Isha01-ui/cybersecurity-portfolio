# ICS Attacks

## Overview
- ICS attacks target industrial processes, often with the goal of disrupting operations, causing physical damage, or stealing sensitive data.
- Understanding attack methods helps in designing defenses.

## Common Attack Types

### 1. Replay Attacks
- Attacker captures valid messages and retransmits them.
- Can cause repeated actions or bypass authentication.
- Example: repeating control commands to a PLC.

### 2. Control Logic Injection
- Malicious modification of PLC programs or ladder logic.
- Can cause unsafe system behavior or physical damage.
- Example: altering a valve control sequence.

### 3. Spoofing
- Pretending to be a legitimate PLC, HMI, or sensor.
- Can manipulate system readings or commands.

### 4. Denial of Service (DoS)
- Flooding the network or device with traffic to stop operations.
- Common in older ICS protocols without built-in protections.

### 5. Case Studies
- **Stuxnet (2010)**: targeted Iranian nuclear centrifuges via PLCs, modifying control logic.
- **Ukraine Power Grid (2015)**: attackers caused a blackout by remotely controlling ICS components.
- **Triton/Trisis (2017)**: malware targeting safety systems in a chemical plant.

## Defensive Measures
- Network segmentation and monitoring
- Regular patching and secure configuration
- Authentication and access control for PLCs and SCADA systems
- Incident response planning
