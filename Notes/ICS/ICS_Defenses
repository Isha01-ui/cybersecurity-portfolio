# ICS Defenses

## Overview
- Securing Industrial Control Systems is critical to prevent disruptions, physical damage, and data theft.
- Defense strategies focus on **prevention, detection, and response**.

## Network Security
- **Segmentation**: separate ICS networks from corporate networks.  
- **Firewalls & Gateways**: control traffic between zones.  
- **Monitoring**: detect unusual traffic patterns and anomalies.

## Access Control
- Strong authentication for PLCs, HMIs, and SCADA servers.  
- Role-based access to restrict user permissions.  
- Avoid default credentials.

## Device Hardening
- Regular firmware and software updates.  
- Disable unnecessary services and ports.  
- Enable logging and audit trails.

## Anomaly Detection
- Monitor control logic and sensor readings for unusual behavior.  
- Set alerts for unexpected commands or network traffic.

## Incident Response
- Develop response plans for ICS security incidents.  
- Include backup systems and safe shutdown procedures.  
- Conduct periodic drills and post-incident analysis.
