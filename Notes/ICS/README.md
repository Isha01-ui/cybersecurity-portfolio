# Industrial Control Systems (ICS)

## Overview
- ICS are systems that control industrial processes (e.g., PLCs, SCADA).  
- Common in manufacturing, energy, water treatment, etc.  

## Key Components
- PLCs – programmable logic controllers  
- SCADA – supervisory control and data acquisition systems  
- Sensors & Actuators  

## Common Vulnerabilities
- Weak authentication  
- Replay attacks  
- Control logic injection  
- Network segmentation flaws  

## Defensive Measures
- Strong authentication and access control  
- Network monitoring and anomaly detection  
- Regular patching and updates
