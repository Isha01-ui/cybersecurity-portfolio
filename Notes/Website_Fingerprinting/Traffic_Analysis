# Traffic Analysis

## Overview
- Traffic analysis studies patterns in network traffic to **infer activity**, even if the content is encrypted.  

## Key Concepts
- **Packet size**: The size of transmitted packets can reveal types of pages or actions.  
- **Timing**: Time intervals between packets can show user behavior.  
- **Direction**: Incoming vs outgoing packets provide clues about communication.  

## Use Cases
- Identify visited websites without decrypting traffic.  
- Detect anomalies or malicious activity on a network.

## Python Examples
- Use `scapy` to capture packet sizes and timing.  
- Analyze metadata instead of content.
